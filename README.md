# Web indexation labs - ENSAI 2024
Cl√©mentine Phung [clementine.phung-ngoc@eleve.ensai.fr]

This course has three labs, and this repository gathers my work for each of those labs. In the folders `./crawler/`, `./index/` and `./ranking/`, you will find a `README.md` corresponding to the lab in question.

## Setting up

Code is written in `Python 3.10`. All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

You can set up a virtualenv using 
```
python create -m venv my_venv
```
Then activate it using
```
source my_venv/bin/activate
```
Finally, install required packages with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## TP1 : Crawler
## TP2 : Index
## TP3 : Querying and ranking
