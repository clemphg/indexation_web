- `linear_ranking(query, filtered_docs, index, weights)`: ranks filtered documents based on a linear ranking score.
- `format_ranking_results(documents, ranking) -> list[dict]`: creates the results dictionnary that will be saved.
- `save_json(data: list, filename: str) -> None`: writes a dictionnary into a JSON file with indents for better readability of the data.
- `main() -> None`: parses arguments and runs the other functions to compute statistics about the corpus as well as the inverted index.
